In an attempt to add the PECL <a href="http://pecl.php.net/package/uploadprogress" target="_blank">Upload Progress</a> package, I received  the following error:

{% highlight bash %}
[root@zebra cbschuld]# pecl install uploadprogress-beta
downloading uploadprogress-0.3.0.tgz ...
Starting to download uploadprogress-0.3.0.tgz (4,677 bytes)
.....done: 4,677 bytes
3 source files, building
running: phpize
sh: phpize: command not found
ERROR: `phpize' failed
{% endhighlight %}

Hmmm, it turns out I never added the package php-devel (oops).  If you are missing phpize on your machine add it with&#58;

{% highlight bash %}
yum install php-devel
{% endhighlight %}
