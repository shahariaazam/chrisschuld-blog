title: Removing Images from a WordPress Post
layout: single-sidebar
category: Wordpress
---

Today I ran across a unique need to remove images from a WordPress post in a specific post loop.  Because there is no way to do a **read more** excerpt while taking strict control of the raw content from `the_content()` I was limited to capturing and manipulating the content from PHP&#39;s output buffer.  My solution&#58; obtain the output from `the_content()` and remove the image tags from the post using `preg_replace()`.

Here is the solution&#58;
{% highlight php %}
<?php
   ob_start();
   the_content('Read the full post',true);
   $postOutput = preg_replace('/<img[^>]+./','', ob_get_contents());
   ob_end_clean();
   echo $postOutput;
?>
{% endhighlight %}
