The browser detection project in php (<a href="http://chrisschuld.com/projects/browser-php-detecting-a-users-browser-from-php/">Browser.php</a>) has been updated to version 1.2 based on suggestions I received in the comments.  The new version is <a href="http://chrisschuld.com/projects/browser-php-detecting-a-users-browser-from-php/">available for download</a> in the project pages.

Thanks to all those who have emailed and commented on the script.
