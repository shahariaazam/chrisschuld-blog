Today I ran across a project need for pdftk (<a title="AccessPDF" href="http://www.accesspdf.com/" target="_blank">AccessPDF</a>) for <a title="CentOS" href="http://centos.org/" target="_blank">CentOS5</a>.  Adding pdftk to CentOS5 was more of struggle than I would have guessed because it was not available in most of the repos I normally use.  Google did not yield any pre-build RPM files for pdftk for CentOS5 so I built them for both 32bit and 64bit.
