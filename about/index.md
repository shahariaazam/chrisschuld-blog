Hello and thank you for visiting my website and blog.

I am Chris Schuld.  I live just outside of Phoenix, Arizona!  I started writing software at a young age and have spent my entire adult life enhancing my knowledge of software and business.  I received my Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Systems Engineering from Arizona State University in 2000.  I spent time sharpening my corporate teeth at Intel Corporation before leaving to start my own ventures.

I maintain a vast technical and business skill set and do my best to extend it each and every day.  I am actively engaged in my company's technical infrastructure from physical and virtual servers to VOIP to implementation factors.  My passion, however, resides in software architecture and software design fundamentals.  I actively design and maintain profitable production products in C#, PHP, Python, Perl and Java.

I energetically manage several ventures and product lines with the help of several other extremely talented people:
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://inspectionsupport.net/">Inspection Support Network</a> – Online Business Management Suite for the Property Inspection Business</li>
	<li><a href="http://einspections.net">eInspections™</a> - Software for creating Property Inspection Reports</li>
	<li><a href="http://SimpleVOIP.net">SimpleVOIP.net</a> – a VOIP Telephony Solutions provider</li>
</ul>
I am always available for short-term consulting and project work.  My fees start at $150/hour for small projects: serious inquiries please.  If you need something done quickly, documented correctly and implemented appropriately you have found the right person.  Software is a inimitable business and I am in the business of software.
